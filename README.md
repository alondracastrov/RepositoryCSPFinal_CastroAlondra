Random Password Generator and Calculator using python

Dice Roller Explanation:  
-Overall function: This program simulates the rolling of a dice  and then displays a random number from a range of 1-6.
-We import random to generate a random number. Then I defined a function called “roll dice” . This function has two parameters which specify the range for which the numbers have to be generated  (min and max)..This function displays that the dice is rolling and then generates the random number between the min and max using the random.randint function which generates   a random integer in the specified range including 1 and 6. The random number generated is then stored in a variable called number which is then displayed to the user.
-We then call the function passing the 1 and 6  as the arguments.

Why I chose to do this project: I chose to make the dice roller as one of my project because it seemeed simple and would 
give me an interesting end product I could show my friends.
